Post 4  ,21 October 2020,"Glad to inform that our novel #COVID19 testing technology, COVIRAP, has been certified by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). https://kgpchronicle.iitkgp.ac.in/icmr-certifies-iit.../
Affordability which is the signature mark of IIT Kharagpur's healthcare technology research, portability, user-friendliness, and accuracy in diagnosis despite the pace of the process, are the key attributes. 
The novel diagnostic platform has been developed by a team of researchers led by Prof. Suman Chakraborty, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, and Dr. Arindam Mondal,  Assistant Professor, School of Bio-Science, IIT Kharagpur. 
This innovation has made high-quality and accurate COVID testing affordable for the common people with a testing cost of around ₹ 500/- which can further be reduced through government intervention. As informed by IIT Kharagpur, this machine can be developed at a cost of less than ₹ 10,000/- with minimal infrastructural requirement making the technology affordable to common people. The testing process in this new machine is completed within one hour. Further, this would go on impacting the lives of many in rural India as the device is portable and can be operated on very low energy supply. Minimally trained rural youth can operate this device.
Talking about the technology, Dr. Shanta Dutta, Director of ICMR-NICED said, “While overseeing the testing and validation, I was very impressed with the portable low-cost machine unit that can truly be a game-changer for COVID-19 diagnostics at peripheral laboratories with the support of unskilled human resources as operators. This now needs a rapid commercial scale-up to cater to the needs of the underserved population. ICMR-NICED will be pleased to facilitate support for further improvisations in the method towards even superior performance.”
Elaborating on the validation process of ‘COVIRAP’ Diagnostic Test, Dr. Mamta Chawla Sarkar, an Internationally acclaimed virologist who oversaw the patient trials on behalf of ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) said, “A detailed scrutiny of the testing results has clearly shown that this assay holds the capability of detecting extremely low levels of viral loads that any other method based on similar principles of testing, even those from the most celebrated research groups across the world, could not come up with so far. In practice, this means that very early stages of infection can be detected, thereby isolating the patient and arresting the uncontrolled spread of infection in the community via asymptomatic patients.” 
While the Institute can produce the testing kit up to a certain scale, patent licensing will facilitate commercialization opportunities for medical technology companies. Any corporate or start-up can approach the Institute for technology licensing and commercial scale of production. The Institute is open to tie-ups, with due measures of protecting the interest of public health amidst the pandemic situation.
The project received financial support from the Institute in late April 2020 through a dedicated fund to support COVID-19 related research and product development as per an initiative by the Ministry of Education, Government. of India following the vision of Dr.Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank Hon’ble Shiksha Mantri ji. Subsequent financial support to this project was provided by the IIT Foundation, USA, to meet the various expenses in the clinical testing phase. Partial financial support has also been provided from IIT Kharagpur's Common Research and Technology Development Hub on Affordable Healthcare, established by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Government of India, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India led by Dr. Harsh Vardhan.

""I cried that night. I cried alot. After they left, i walked less than 100 steps to our building. Almost went to their apartment, only to realise i don't have the key anymore. Came back to mine. It was empty. Well, not really empty. I had chick jr and duck jr with me. The fooseball table is gone. The worst, i switched on the tv and there was free porn, again. I looked on my left to high five Chandler, but he was gone. I went to his room, i kind of missed him. He left me money. I always knew he had me covered. Whatever happened, he was there. He is my best friend. He made me laugh when i was low. He made us all laugh, actually. I miss him when i am laughing. The day he decided to move in with Monica, I wanted to stop him. He could have just stayed here, with her. Or whatever. But i am happy for him. He is a dad now. Who could have imagined, him being a dad. But I am sure Monica is going to be there. She is going to make him learn how to be a good father. She has fed me for more than 10 years. Her apartment was home to me. Mine was just another place to sleep. She is the best chef I have ever met. I am going to miss her turkey. She used to make the best turkey. She left me lasagna. Oh boy! And when she broke that fooseball table wide open, I was scared. She is one strong woman. I loved Jack and Erica. They are so cute. Erica smiled at me when I asked, ""how you doin'?"" I am so happy for them. But Ross, he was the happiest. I have never seen him happier. Rachel got off the plane. And he felt like he found some dinosaur from some years ago. Ross, told me that he'll take Monica's apartment. I thought there will be friends next door. But I don't know how long is that going to be. Rachel, I am proud of her, you know. She made it big. Are you serious? She got Ralph Lauren shirts, no one knows about them. I fell in love with her, and trust me I could not have been more scared. There was Ross. And then, she was pregnant. It is all I'm the past. Gone. And I am going to give away Hugsy. To Emma. She will love it. Ben and I still talk about the time we left him on a bus. He still laughs at it. I miss seeing him. Phoebe, you know, it was one of the happiest moments of my life, when I gave Phoebe away at the wedding. Mike seems like a solid guy. We have had our talk. He'd never hurt Phoebe. She was the most honest one. Loved her French lessons, still curses me for not learning any French. Or for that matter, guitar.
A lot has changed since that night. We to Monica's and Chandler's, every weekend. I sleep there, sometimes. We still play poker. Phoebe still gives an odd joker away because she thinks he's sad. Monica and Chandler are proud parents. Ross and Rachel are still deciding on when to get married. And me, I am still auditioning. After all, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on DOOLS.""

Hope you are staying safe and healthy in this time of crisis. Everyone of you is aware of the current situation we are facing. Myself, the Students Senate as well as the student reps of TSG have been trying our best to get a clarification from the administration about this fees issue. But despite multiple follow-ups we were unable to get any satisfactory response. Therefore, the students' senate has passed a resolution to stand with the students' voice and sort this issue at the earliest. The same is attached in this post below, I request you all to go through the same. 
Lastly, I request all of you to not pay any fees till the matter gets resolved. We are your student representatives and firmly stand with the you all, the students fraternity. We are here to raise your issues and fight for your rights. Be assured that we will do whatever it takes to make our collective demands met. Hence, I again urge you to not pay any fees and stand with us in this fight. We have to and will work together to get over this. It's not me or myself, it's we. Let's progress ahead as a family.

The majority of the Indian audience is not English-speaking and most of the startups pander to the largely English speaking audience which has access to the internet. The different entrepreneurs out there should think about what ‘Bharat’ wants, and try and work inclusively. Taking the example of Kabaddi, we can see that though it is largely popular in the rural areas of the country, we don’t give it as much importance as some of the other games like Cricket or Football. To create a real impact, we need to focus on the largely vernacular audience, who make up the majority of the Indian population, says our speaker, Mr Arvind Sivdas. He is an IIT Madras and IIM Calcutta graduate who has founded 3 startups to date. Arvind Sivdas was always the inventor, the entrepreneur! His startup, Messy fractals, helps the players of Kabaddi predict the moves of their opponents, using Data Analytics.
